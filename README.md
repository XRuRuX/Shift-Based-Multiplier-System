# Shift-Based-Multiplier-System

## Description
This project is a shift-based multiplier that calculates the product of two positive 8-bit numbers. The system has a data path and control path, with a LOAD button to input operands sequentially and start the multiplication. Results and partial sums are displayed on 16 LEDs. Additional buttons allow stepping through each state and multiplexing the LED display between partial sums, shifted operand A, and shifted operand B. A control unit manages synchronization.
